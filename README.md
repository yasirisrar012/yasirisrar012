As a passionate and results-driven Data Analytics professional I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. My expertise lies in leveraging tools like Python, SQL, Excel and Power BI to analyze, visualize, and interpret data, ensuring that organizations can make informed, data-driven decisions.

I am highly skilled in using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to handle data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. My background in engineering has honed my analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and attention to detail, which are crucial in the ever-evolving field of data analytics.

I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to bridge the gap between raw data and strategic business solutions, whether through advanced data engineering practices, optimizing data pipelines, or creating dynamic dashboards that highlight key trends. I am eager to contribute to innovative teams where I can apply my skills to drive meaningful outcomes.

If you are looking for a dedicated professional who is not only technically proficient but also has a keen understanding of business analytics, I would love to connect and explore how I can contribute to your team.
